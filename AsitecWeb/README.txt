Project Experience

I am very happy for opportunity. I would like to glad for show a little about my knowledge.

Some points about project required

1 - Firstly, I have had problem with environment and waste much time correct it. It was my falt.
But, I would like to say sorry, but I may show my knowledge during the project construction.

2 - Because that time wasted, I have no time to finish it, then I need to say that could be a problem,
but it may be corrected.

3 - To correct it, you should put dependencies of spring framework, create a database using sqlite very simple.

4 - To show it on Front end, you may use angulaJs because I converted Entity in JSon Object.


Thank you very much

Best Regards
